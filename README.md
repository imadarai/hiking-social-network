Once you have registered or logged in, you land on your profile page. The application will initially assign you a default profile picture. You can change the picture anytime by clicking on it. Moreover, you can add or edit your bio anytime.

There is an incremental search allowing you to look for other users. Once on the other user's profile you can peform different actions depending on your existing friendship status with the respective user. Possibilities include sending/cancelling a friend request, unfriending or accepting/rejecting their request.
